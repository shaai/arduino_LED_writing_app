Light Painting with Arduinos
==========================
A multi-user chat-like application that sends typed messages to an arduino. The arduino prints the messages at a very high speed through an LED matrix. Wave the LED screen quickly to see the letters, or better yet, take pictures with a camera set to slow shutter speed and see the messages printed out in the air.
